In 1968, the US passed the Gun Control Act, which made it legal for people to have guns. But this law is very strict. People who want to own guns have to get approval from the police and pay $200 in tax. They also need to pass a criminal record check to make sure that they are not criminals and will not use the gun to fire at people. Furthermore, they need to register their gun with the police and also send their fingerprints and a photograph to a government agency. This registration process takes about 6 months. It also takes 30 days to get permission to take a gun from one US state to another. Full-automatic firearms cost about $8,000 and are very hard to get. Because of these<b> restrictions </b>and rules, only 30% of all Americans actually own guns. But the number is probably higher since many people keep guns illegally. There is a lot of <b>debate</b> and discussion over the right to have a gun. Many political parties argue that people have the right to carry a gun to protect themselves. If a thief uses force to <b>break into</b> a home and steal something, then the owner of the house can scare him away by showing his weapon. It seems that 2.5 million lives are saved each year in the USA because people use guns for protection.

In fact, gun-right <b>advocates</b> are in favor of making guns legal because guns keep crime low. Since 1990, the crime rate has gone down by almost 70%. This happened mostly because people are recently allowed to carry guns with them when going out. Criminals are less likely to attack someone on the street if they know that a person might have a gun on him or her. Gun-right groups also say that guns should not be registered. In case of a new attack against the USA, terrorists can find a registered gun and use them against the local population.

<b>The Need for Gun Control</b>

However, there are many groups in the USA that <b>take a hard line</b> against guns. They are strongly against making guns legal because firearms are very dangerous. Often, people who use guns do not have proper training and can shoot someone by accident. Recently, some older children were playing alone in the house. They found their father's gun unlocked in a bedroom drawer. They wanted to pretend that they were shooting at each other. But the gun was loaded and one child was killed, while two others were badly injured. Gun-control groups use this terrible accident to show why guns should be made illegal. They argue that guns actually make people more violent. Some research has shown that for every time a gun is used to prevent a crime there are 22 shootings by accident. 76.6% of all victims were killed by a relative or someone they knew, and only 3.6% were shot at by criminals. The rest of the shootings involved police or the army. The risk for violence is five times greater in households where there are guns available. Most of the shootings happen after family members fight with each other. In other serious cases, teenagers brought guns to school and began shooting at their teachers and classmates. In the end, they <b>committed suicide</b> by killing themselves with the same gun.

More than 30,000 people are killed each year by guns. Many shootings are gang-related, and most shots are fired from illegal guns. Thus gun-right groups argue that if guns were legal, the police and the government would have more control over who uses a gun or not. Statistics show that most gun owners are highly educated middle-class people who live in small towns.
