Beauty and the Beast is actually a very old folktale. Folktales are stories that are passed verbally from generation to generation. They have never been written down, only told or spoken. Therefore, they undergo quite many changes throughout time. In 1740, Madame Gabrielle Suzanne Barbot de
Villeneuve published the first written form of the story in a magazine. But the story became famous after Madame Jeanne Marie Leprince Beaumont wrote a shorter version of it in 1756. It was then translated into English in 1757.

The plot or story of Beauty and the Beast is a little unusual. A beautiful girl falls in love with a horrible monster after he keeps her prisoner in his castle. The girl begs the beast to let her visit her father, and he agrees. But the girl returns only after such a long time that the Beast is <b>out of his mind with worry</b>. He missed her a lot and now he is dying. The girl asks him to live for her, and this act of love changes the beast into a prince. The tale was made into a wonderful movie by French moviemaker Jean Cocteau in 1946.

Walt Disney Company had always wanted to turn Beauty and the Beast into an animation movie. They had already been successful with Snow White, Cinderella and Sleeping Beauty. But Beauty and the Beast was a very difficult project. First, there wasn't a lot of action in the story. Most of the time, the two main characters are sitting at the dinner table talking, and this is not very exciting. Secondly, the characters were very simple. They were both kind and loving, but not very interesting to watch. Also, in the end, people got to like the beast and were disappointed to see him change into a prince. Disney <b>put </b>the making of Beauty and the Beast<b> on hold</b> for many years until they finally decided to give it a try.

Disney put together a group of young but very talented writers. These writers first drew the story on big cardboards and changed the storyline. They had a prince turn into beast because he was unkind to an old woman. The whole story now was about a young man learning to love again. Then the writers developed the two main characters and added other minor characters to the movie. These characters actually feel like real people, and are also very funny. There is also a <b>villain</b> in the story. Gaston is a handsome, but bad man, who wants to take Belle away from the Beast. The message of the story was still clear; beauty comes from within. This message is also carried by the wonderful music of the movie. Beauty and the Beast is a movie both parents and their children love, and is considered the most beautiful love story ever told.
