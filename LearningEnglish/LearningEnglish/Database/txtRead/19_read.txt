Romania is a small country that lies in the Balkan region in South Eastern Europe. Its neighboring countries are all Slavic nations, such as Serbia, Bulgaria and Russia. Its other neighbor, Hungary, is a Finnish nation. On the other hand, people in Romania speak Romanian, which is a Latin language, just like Italian, French and Spanish. Thus historians have <b>dubbed</b> or nicknamed Romania "a Latin island in a Slavic sea".
</br>
</br>
The reason why Romania is the only Latin country in the Balkans lies in the past. Thousands of years ago, Romania was inhabited by the Geto-Daks. This native population was made of proud warriors who lived high in the mountains. Many times they managed to defeat the <b>mighty</b> and powerful Roman soldiers. Finally, in the year 1000, the Roman Emperor Trajan sent a huge army across the border<b> to take</b> the Geto-Daks <b>by storm</b>. The Romans were too many and too well-trained for the Geto-Daks to have a chance. They were defeated, and the Romans built a new colony in that part of the world. Many Roman soldiers married Geto-Daks women and taught them Latin ways. After the Romans left, the population had been changed so much in language and culture that it now called itself Romanian. During the Middle Ages, Romanians <b>struggled</b> to form their own country. They fought hard to unify all Romanian people under one ruler. But high and steep mountains divide the country, and it was difficult to travel across and<b> keep in touch with </b>neighbors. Many small rulers called voyvods controlled different parts of Romania, but they had little contact with each other and were often at war with one another. Therefore, it was easy for more powerful countries to conquer these different parts of Romania and rule them by force.

</br>
For centuries, Romania was basically dominated by three different Empires. Southern Romania, or Muntenia, was under the tough rule of the Turkish Empire. Romanian voyvods were forced to send their sons to the Turkish capital so that they were raised in Turkish ways. Eastern Romania, or Moldavia, had to pay protection money to the Russian Empire. Western Romania, or Transylvania, was part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. People went to German schools and were not allowed to speak their own language. It was a very humiliating period in Romanian history.
</br>
</br>
Finally, in 1871, when the Turks were at war with Russia, Romanians fought bravely and earned their freedom. Muntenia was united with Moldavia under the wise rule of prince Alexander Cuza. But it would take many more years <b>to make their dream come true</b>. At the end of the First World War, Romanians finally achieved what they had wanted for such a long time. Transylvania was united with Romania on December 1, 1918. This date is a Romanian national holiday.

</br>
The period between the two World Wars was Romania's Golden Age. The economy was strong, there was little unemployment, the government was democratic, arts and culture were developing. Many people went to study abroad. The Second World War put an end to that. Romania first fought on the side of Germany because its king was of German origin. But in 1944, the Communist party came in power. The king was sent away, and the country switched sides to fight alongside the Communist Soviet Union.
</br>
</br>
When the war ended, Romania became a Communist country. For 50 years, people suffered under the Communist rule. There was little food, no electricity or hot water in villages and small cities. Many important pieces of Romanian literature and art from the Golden Age were destroyed. People were put in jail; others ran illegally across the border to other countries. On December 16, 1998, Romanians had had enough. There was a bloody revolution, the government was overthrown, and new elections were held. Today, Romanians are trying to rebuild their future in a free country.
