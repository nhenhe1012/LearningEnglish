Marriage nowadays is a choice people make on their own. But this has not always been the case in society. Thousands of years ago, there were fewer people that lived in the world. The average lifespan was shorter than it is today. A man usually lived until he was about 40 years old, while women died even sooner because of childbirth. There were many wars, many illnesses, and people had to protect themselves by making more children while they were still young. The parents lived through their children.

Marriage was not so much a romantic love story but a business transaction, or deal. Most marriages were arranged between parents while their children were still very young. It was the custom that the fathers chose who their children were going to marry. The mother <b>had little to say in it</b> since she rarely made any decisions outside the household. Usually, the fathers met to arrange the wedding date and the <b>dowry</b> the bride would receive on her wedding day. The more money and land a girl had, the more chances she had to marry well. Therefore, it was important that her father chose the bridegroom very well. Usually, it was someone who came from a good family or who was rich too. It was very unlikely that people married outside their social class. A few <b>well-off </b>and rich merchants got to marry poorer noblewomen and became king's business advisors. In a way, poor peasants had an easier choice as it was less important whom they married.

The practice of arranged marriages is still common in some countries in the Middle East, such as India or Pakistan. Here, social classes are still strongly divided and very well kept. Often, however, arranged marriages are a sign that people do not want to let go of the past. The past gives them comfort and security in an ever-changing world.

An interesting form of arranged marriages can be found throughout the British Empire in the 18th-19th centuries. At that time, England had established many colonies all around the globe. But these places were very far away. If people came to live there, they did not return to England ever again since traveling by ship was rather long and dangerous. Englishmen who settled in such far-off colonies often found themselves alone. The only women around were the natives. But while French, Spaniards and Dutch saw no trouble in marrying native women, Englishmen were very conservative. They would write letters home and ask relatives or neighbors to send them a local wife. Many women had no dowry so they agreed to the transaction. The man would pay for their ship voyage to the colonies and the woman would work all her life to pay him back. It is believed that these marriages were the happiest of all. The 20th century saw marriages opening up. But marriage and family still played an important role in society. In the 50s, families were very <b>closely knit</b> and tight since the Second World War had done a lot of damage to society. A traditional nuclear family consisted of a working father and stay-at-home mother, as well as their two or three children. Divorce <b>was frowned upon</b>, and many women stayed in an unhappy marriage out of shame to ask for a divorce.

The feminist movement of the 70s brought an end to this situation. Unfortunately, 70% of marriages end in a divorce nowadays. Also more children are born<b> out of wedlock</b> since it is no longer shameful to give birth without being married. In fact, more people chose to stay single or get married in their late thirties. Often, marriages are common-law, with two people sharing the same house and bank account without being formally married. There are a lot of single parents raising their children, while countries like Canada, Belgium, Spain and the Netherlands have recently legalized gay marriages.
