The Indy500 Racing League (IRL) is a car racing championship that takes place on oval speed tracks or courses in the USA. The name Indy comes from the most famous and largest speed track in the world, the Indianapolis 500. This speed track, as well as IRL are owned by the car company Hulman & CO. Tony George, the president of Hulman & CO and of the Indianapolis Speed track, decided to <b>break away</b> from the American Car Championships (CART) and make his own championship. He and a few other drivers separated from CART because they wanted to race more cheaply built open cars, and also give young drivers a chance. There was a lot of <b>controversy</b> over this move. CART argued against it in court, but eventually lost. Many car drivers moved from CART to Indy500 so that CART finally stopped existing.

Interestingly, Tony George wanted an open car race series with over 33 cars, but right now Indy500 runs exactly like the former CART series. There are only 11 very strong teams involved, each team having not more than 3 drivers. Races are held every weekend during the summer for 14 weeks in a row. There is a <b>qualifying round </b>on Saturday, and only the best times are allowed to compete the next day. On Sunday, qualified drivers all start from the same starting line, then race about 100 times around the track at over 200mph. There are a lot of overtaking and crashes, and many drivers and <b>officials</b> have died. Indy500 became very unpopular, so people who work for Indy500 had to make changes to the tracks and cars to make them safer.

Indy cars are built by two companies, Dallara and Panoz. They make cars especially for oval tracks, with wings in front and the back, and big airboxes. The oil and cooling systems are built on either side of the car. Honda makes all 650 horsepower Indy engines.

The Formula1 Grand Prix Series
</br>
</br>
Formula One started as a European car-racing championship in 1950. It is now an international competition organized by the International Automobile Federation in Paris. Its president is Max Mosley, but the real organizer is Italian Bernie Ecclestone. He made some good changes when Formula One <b>hit some hard times</b> in the late nineties. Famous car driver Ayrton Senna died on the track, and there were also problems when German champion Michael Schumacher won the Grand Prix so many years in a row that it became uninteresting to watch. Ecclestone introduced a lot of strict safety rules in the car design. He also changed the rules of the competition. There are many qualifying rounds before the actual race, and drivers start one behind the other. Ever since these changes, no driver ever died in Formula One again. This championship is the most watched competition in the world right now after soccer and baseball.

</br>
The Formula One season usually starts in March and is held every second weekend until the end of November. There are a total of 18 races in one season. Half of these races are held in Europe, but there are many races on other continents too. The only place without a Formula One race is Africa.

There are 10 teams involved, each team having 2 drivers. The best teams are Renault, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, Honda and Toyota. These teams built both the car and its engine. Formula One also has a constructor's championship for the team that builds the best car. The cars are much smaller and narrower because Formula One is not run on speed tracks, but on circuits and sometimes on closed city streets. The drivers must be more technical and skilled on these types of tracks. Some circuits, like the ones in Monaco, are very tight, and it is hard <b> to overtake</b> there. Circuits such as Monza, Italy, or Germany, are very fast and wide. Cars reach up to 200 mph, and the engines have around 750 horsepower.
