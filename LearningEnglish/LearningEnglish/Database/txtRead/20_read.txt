The Aztec people were American Indians who used to live in Mexico and other Mesoamerican or Central American countries, such as Guatemala and Honduras. The Aztecs came from the northern parts of America and settled in Mexico around 1325. They organized a very powerful kingdom and built their capital city of Tenochtitlan. At the height of the Aztec Empire, Tenochtitlan had a population of about 130,000 people, which made it the second largest city in the world at that time. The Aztecs had a very<b> sophisticated </b>and developed culture. They were excellent farmers, builders and scientists. They had their own writing system, and created wonderful jewelry out of pure gold.

Many European countries had heard about the wealth and riches of the Aztecs. The Spanish king sent his ships across the Atlantic to bring home the famous Aztec gold. Thus many Spanish sailors and soldiers went in search of the New World and found America. These adventurers were called "conquistadors" because they were <b>ruthless</b> and cruel. They only cared about money, not people, and destroyed entire civilizations to get what they wanted. One of these conquistadors was Hernando Cortes. He arrived in Cuba in 1511, but soon got in trouble with the Cuban governor, Diego Velasquez, who eventually sent him far away to find the Aztec gold.

Cortes left Santiago de Cuba in 1518 armed with 600 soldiers, 16 horses and many cannons. He wanted to escape Velasquez and also<b> make his fortune</b> and become rich by conquering the Aztecs. He soon landed on the eastern Mexican coast, where he founded the city of Vera Cruz. Here he met Malinche, the daughter of a local chief. Malinche offered to help Cortes because she fell in love with him, but also for another reason. The Aztecs were feared warriors. They had conquered many Mexican tribes, one of which was Malinche's. Malinche wanted <b>to get back</b> at the Aztecs and make them pay for what they did to her people. She went to talk to other Mexican tribes, who agreed to help Cortes beat the Aztecs.

Cortes arrived in Tenochtitlan on November 10, 1519. His men were impressed by how big and well developed the city was. But the Aztecs were shocked to see cannons and horses. Their weapons were made of wood and animal leather, while the Spaniards had metal helmets, breastplates and swords. The Aztec Emperor Montezuma thought the Spaniards were gods who had come to destroy his people. Therefore he welcomed Cortes into his palace, kissed the ground before his feet and showered him with gifts of gold. But Cortes cheated Montezuma. He took his gold, but kept him a prisoner in his own palace.

Soon after, Cortes got news that one of his own men had made himself king in Vera Cruz. Cortez rushed off to deal with the problem. While he was away, his soldiers attacked an Aztec religious meeting and killed many locals. The population <b>turned on</b> the Spaniards and started to fight them. When Cortes returned, he tried to get Montezuma to calm his people, but the Aztecs didn't like their king and stoned him to death. Finally, after a bloody fight, Cortes lost so many men that he had to leave Tenochtitlan and find protection with a neighboring tribe. On August 1521, Cortes returned to the Aztec capital accompanied by a large army of local tribes. He surrounded and <b>besieged</b> Tenochtitlan. The people inside the city walls had no food or water for nearly three months. Most died of hunger, but also of a terrible disease, smallpox, which the Spaniards had brought with them from Europe. Cortes destroyed Tenochtitlan and conquered the remaining Aztecs. Mexico City exists today in place of the old Tenochtitlan.
