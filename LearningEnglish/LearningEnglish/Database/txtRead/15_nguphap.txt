An interesting form of 1%@ marriages can be found throughout the British Empire in the 18th-19th centuries. 2%@ that time, England had established many colonies all around the globe. But these places were very far 3%@. If people came to live there, they did not return to England ever again since traveling 4%@ ship was 5%@ long and dangerous. Englishmen who settled in such far-off colonies often found 6%@ alone. The only women around were the natives. But 7%@ French, Spaniards and Dutch saw no trouble in marrying native women, Englishmen were very conservative. They would write letters home and ask relatives or neighbors to send 8%@ a local wife. Many women had no dowry so they agreed to the transaction. The man would pay for their ship voyage to the colonies and the woman would work all her life to pay 9%@ back. It is believed that these marriages were 10%@ of all.
