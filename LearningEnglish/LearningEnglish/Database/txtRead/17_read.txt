Japan <b>announced</b> on April 14th, 2006 that it plans to do some research on a small island in the Sea of East. The Times World Atlas calls the place Liancourt Rocks, which is actually a group of 33 small islands. Liancourt Rocks lies about 87 km (54 miles) east of the Ullung islands in South Korea and 157 kilometers northwest of Oki islands in Japan. It has been<b> a point of contention</b> between the two countries for a long time now. The disagreement started in 1905, when Japan attached the island to its Empire and called it Takeshima. Five years later, Japan also occupied the rest of Korea and attacked other Asian countries. But it was <b>defeated</b> in 1945 after the Second World War and lost most of its possessions. In 1954, South Korea<b> took over</b> the island and called it Dokdo.

At the moment, the South Korean army controls and protects the island. Only a fisherman and his wife live on Liancourt Rocks now. But the waters around the island are rich in different kinds of fish. It does not look like a very important piece of land on the map. But Japan claims that Liancourt Rocks belongs to them. They say they own the island by right. Japan is no longer an Empire. When it lost all of its colonies, it also lost Korea and Dokdo Island. Dokdo Island has always been Korean territory and part of its country. Japan wants to rebuild its Empire by sending its ships there. On the other hand, Japan claims that it only wants to check the waters for more fish. There are many South Korean fishing boats in the area and Japanese fishermen have no place to do their own fishing. However, Japan has similar problems with two other neighbors, China and Russia, over two other islands, Senkaku/Diaoyu and North Territories/Kurils. Liancourt Rocks may seem an unimportant matter, but it is not. If Japan gives up its right to it, it has a good chance of losing its right to the other islands as well. Japan has <b>demanded</b> that the USA act as a judge in this argument, but South Korea refuses to have another country make decisions regarding over its own land. It has also asked international organizations to rename the Sea of Japan the East Sea.

It seemed that the problem was to be solved in a friendly manner. Last year was Korea-Japan Friendship Year. However, in March 2005, Japan has declared February 22nd "Takeshima Day".

Matters went from bad to worse when the Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi visited a monument in Tokyo that also honors 14 war criminals. This visit has angered many Asian countries. In fact, China has recently met with South Korea to discuss what they call a "Japanese invasion". China has promised to support South Korea in the Sea of Japan in return for Korea's support of China in the Yellow Sea. China would also like to help North and South Korea <b>to bridge the gap</b> between them and become friendly again.

Meanwhile, a Japanese ship has left the island of Honshu on April 17th and is scheduled to return on April 26th. In response, 18 South Korean boats are checking the waters near the island to make sure nobody lands there. The South Korean Vice Foreign Minister Yu Myung Hwan has made an official protest with the Japanese embassy in Seoul. It is therefore possible that the Japanese trip will be delayed until matters calm down.
