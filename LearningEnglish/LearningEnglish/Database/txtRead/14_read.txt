Maria Mutola was born in 1972 in the little African country of Mozambique. Maria grew up in the poor suburbs of Maputo, the capital of Mozambique. Her father worked at the railway, and her mother sold fruits and vegetables at the local street market. Even as a young child, Maria <b>was eager to</b> play sports. She was especially interested in soccer, and always played with the boys. This is how she became such a tough runner later. A former athlete saw her run on the field and decided to coach her. At first, Maria was <b>discouraged</b> with the hard training and wanted to give up. But at age 15, after only training a few months, she won the silver medal in the 800 metres at the African Championships. This gave her the courage to go on. In the same year, she ran a personal best time at the 1988 Summer Olympic Games, but did not qualify for the finals.

Over the next years, Mutola had no chance to train properly, but still won any event in which she participated in Africa. Because of her<b> potential</b> and talent, the International Olympic Committee sent her to the USA to train on a scholarship. In 1991, Maria finished 4th at the World Championships in Tokyo with a World junior record of 1:57:63. The only reason she <b>lost out on</b>a medal and didn't win was the fact that other runners fell in front of her and blocked her way to the finish line. She also didn't win a medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics.

After these disappointments, Maria Mutola decided to move back to South Africa. Her US coach, Margo Jennings, faxed her the training schedules there, and the change <b>paid off</b>. Maria Mutola won any race she ever competed in between 1992 and 1996. She became a triple indoor and outdoor world champion, and broke the world record twice in 1995. She was the first woman to run the 1000m in under two and a half minutes, beating the other athletes who were her competition by over 2 seconds. Still, at the 1996 Summer Olympics, she lost the gold medal again because she was sick with the flu.

Many people think Maria Mutola is one of the greatest female runners of all times. She won the 1997 World Championships only weeks after her father was killed in a car crash. In total, she has nine 800-metre world titles, and is also a world cup and Commonwealth champion. Her greatest moment came at the 2000 Olympic Games in Sydney when she finally won the gold medal in the 800m. The people of Mozambique were so proud of her that they named a street in Maputo after her. A BBC reporter called her "The Maputo Express" because she was so fast and strong.

Maria Mutola is a great athlete off the field as well. She has started the Lurdes Mutola Foundation. This <b>charity</b> program raises money for the development of sports and the education of young people in Africa. It also works to stop the spread of AIDS and HIV in poor countries, and to have all African children protected against such dangerous childhood diseases as measles and polio. Maria Mutola has also donated money to build new social houses in Maputo, as well as a modern outdoor running track. She is also involved in promoting sports without drugs and doping. For her achievements, Maria Mutola has been made a youth ambassador for the United Nations in 1993. She also carried the official Olympic Flag at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin.
