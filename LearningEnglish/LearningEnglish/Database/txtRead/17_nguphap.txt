Japan is no longer an Empire. When it lost 1%@ its colonies, it also 2%@ Korea and Dokdo Island. Dokdo Island has always been Korean territory and part of its country. Japan only wants to rebuild its Empire by 3%@ its ships there. On the other hand, Japan says that it only wants to check 4%@ for more fish. There are many South Korean fishing boats in the area and Japanese fishermen have no place to do their own 5%@. However, Japan has similar problems with two 6 %@ and Russia, over two other islands, Senkaku/Diaoyu 7%@ North Territories/Kurils. Liancourt Rocks may 8%@ an unimportant matter, but it is not. If Japan gives up its right to it, it has a good chance of losing its right to the other islands as well. Japan has demanded the USA to act 9%@ a judge in this argument, but South Korea refuses to 10%@ another country decide over its own land.
