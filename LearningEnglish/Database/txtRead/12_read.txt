Ang Lee was born on October 23, 1954, in Pingtun County, a farming area in Southern Taiwan. The Lee family had emigrated from China and was very educated. Ang's father was principal of the prestigious Tainan First Senior High School. He was very strict and asked his children to study old

Chinese literature and calligraphy, or the art of ancient handwriting. Ang, however, <b>couldn't </b>stand rules and disliked too much discipline. He was very creative, and preferred thinking about people and their relationships with each other. Ang tried to please his father and go to college. But he failed to pass the annual entrance examination for two years in a row. Finally, after the third try, he got into the National Art School, from which he graduated in 1975. <b>Frustrated </b>with his studies and upset at his lack of success in school, Ang Lee decided to do art.

In Taiwan, every man or boy must serve in the army for one year. After finishing his <b>mandatory</b> military service, Lee moved to the USA in 1979. He got his bachelor degree in Theatre from the University of Illinois. Then he enrolled in the Tisch School of Arts in New York, where he got his Masters in Fine Arts. Ang Lee was a colleague of the famous director Spike Lee.

Together they worked on the movie Joe Bed-Stuy Barbershop: We cut heads, and on the short drama Fine Line (1984), which won at the students' movie festival in New York. Ang Lee's work <b>caught the eye </b>of the William Morris Agency. This agency became interested in Ang's movies and hired him. But in the end, they did not give Ang Lee a chance to make movies in the USA. For 6 years, Lee stayed home to take care of the house and his two children. His wife, Jane Ling, was a molecular biologist and supported the family. This situation was embarrassing for Lee because of the culture he grew up in. But, during this hard time, he wrote many screenplays for movies.

In 1990, he sent two screenplays to a competition in Taiwan and won both the first and the second prize. A big Taiwanese filmmaker, Li-Kong Hsu, invited Ang Lee to turn these screenplays into movies. Lee went to Taiwan and made Pushing Hands in 1992, and The Wedding Banquet a year later. Both movies tell the stories of Chinese/Taiwanese immigrants to the USA and won awards at many international film festivals. In 1995, Ang Lee produced Eat Drink Man Woman, a story that looks at traditional family relationships in modern Taipei. It was such a successful movie that a Hollywood director made a remake of it. This is the first Asian movie ever turned into an American film.

This unbelievable success made Ang Lee one of the most</b> sought-after </b>moviemakers in Hollywood. In 1995, he directed the classical British novel Sense and Sensibility. He followed up with The Ice Storm (1997) and Ride with the Devil (1998), which, however, were not very popular with moviegoers. In 2000, Ang Lee went back to Taiwan to film Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, a traditional martial arts movie made entirely in Chinese. Surprisingly perhaps, this movie was <b>a box-office hit</b>. Everybody went to see it. It also received the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film. Ang Lee's latest successes are Hulk (2003) and Brokeback Mountain (2005). This last movie is the story of two gay Wyoming cowboys, for which Lee got the Oscar for Best Director.
