Hawaii is a small but beautiful group of islands in the South East Pacific Ocean. It is <b>inhabited </b>by Polynesians. People from the Pacific islands of Tahiti, Tonga and Samoa came to live in Hawaii centuries ago, and brought with them the hula dance. This dance is now unique to the Hawaiian Islands. It is danced only there. The hula is accompanied by a "mele"; it is performed together with this chant or song in order to explain or comment on it.

The origins of the hula dance<b> are clouded in mystery</b>. It is not clear how the hula came to be, although there are a few legends to explain it. According to one legend, the Hawaiian goddess Laka gave birth to the dance on the island of Molokai. Another story talks of Hi'iaka, who danced to calm down her sister Pele, a volcano goddess. This story places the hula on the volcanic island of Kauai.

The old version of the hula is the hula kahiko. It is a very melodic and sensuous dance, performed to bring pleasure to the senses. The dancers gently move their hips back and forth, while singing and telling a story with their fingers. Hula kahikos can be funny fishermen stories, or very serious historical tales. Many of them were performed to entertain or praise kings or chiefs. But the most serious hulas were religious performances done inside a temple. It was a sign of bad luck to make a mistake during a hula performance. Therefore, dancers were <b>secluded </b>inside the temple while learning the dance. They could not be seen by anybody, and were not allowed to leave until they <b>knew</b> the dance <b>by heart </b>and could execute it without any mistakes.

Today the hula kahiko is performed to traditional songs that talk about old legends, historical events or kings. These songs have been passed down from generation to generation<b> by way of mouth</b>. They have been memorized exactly word by word and told to the youngsters so that they can perform perfectly as well. The words of the hula are taken very seriously, and therefore the dancers who do the hula have quite a <b>solemn</b> and severe expression on their face. They have been trained at a special hula school, called the "halau", under the strict supervision of a hula teacher. The teacher is called a "kumu hula", which means "source of knowledge".

Traditionally, male and female hula dancers wear nothing except a skirt, which they wrap around their hips. Both men and women decorate themselves with many bracelets, necklaces, anklets and headpieces. These are usually made of "leis", a sacred flower picked in forests during prayers. Leis are only worn once. After a hula performance, they are left at the temple of the goddess Laka. Hula dancers use several different instruments during a performance. These usually include small drums made of coconut shells, as well as bamboo sticks, and rattles made of feathers, dogteeth or lava stones.

When the Christians arrived in Hawaii during the 18th century, they were shocked by the hula dance. They thought it was very sexual and rude. The dance was forbidden, but King David Kalakaua (1874-1891) brought the hula back to life. The modern hula form is called the hula auana. It is still a religious dance, but it includes a lot of Christian ideas. The songs are westernized and more melodic, and the text includes events that happened after 1800. A hula singer usually accompanies the dancers, and often plays the guitar, the bass or the ukulele.
