Emily Carr was a painter who was born in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada, in 1912. She was the second youngest of nine children. Her parents came to Canada from England and they were very <b>strict</b>, which means they did not give her much freedom. They wanted Emily to be a nice, polite young lady. From a very early age however, Emily <b>had a mind of her own</b>, so she did not listen to what other people told her to do. She loved to draw, paint and write, and she liked being alone.

Sadly, her mother died when Emily was fifteen and her father died two years later. There were no art schools or artists at that time in her hometown of Victoria so she moved to San Francisco so that she could study art. Emily also went to London and Paris to study art but in her heart she wanted to be back in Canada. She did not succeed in Paris so she was discouraged. When Emily returned to Canada, almost giving up art altogether, she met Lawren Harris, a famous Canadian painter. He encouraged her to paint using her own special style.

Emily loved to paint the land of the Pacific coast of British Columbia. She painted skies, dark forests and Native Indian villages. Her style was powerfuland energetic, just like the land she loved to paint. Emily Carr had a very strong personality. She was very <b>independent </b>and creative, but she was also<b> moody</b> and unfriendly with people she didn't like. In the studio where she painted, the chairs were hanging from the ceiling with ropes so there was no place for visitors to sit down. Maybe if she liked the visitor, she would use a rope to bring down a chair to sit on! She<b> had a soft spot</b> for animals and kept dogs, cats, rabbits and even a pet monkey named "Woo"!

Emily often traveled by herself to Native Indian villages in the forests far away from her hometown. She liked <b>roughing it</b> so she often traveled by canoe and slept in a tent. At this time it was not usual for women to travel alone, so many people thought she was very strange. The Native Indian people liked Emily very much and welcomed her to their villages. They even gave her the Indian name Klee Wik, which means “laughing one”.

Unfortunately, she never was financially successful as an artist and she had to rent out rooms in her house to make money. She also taught childrens' art classes. Many people didn't understand Emily's strong painting style. At this time, the style of art people wanted to see was pretty pictures of flowers, not strange paintings of Indian life or dark forests. For this reason, Emily Carr (like many other famous artists) could not support herself by being an artist and she didn't become famous until after she died.

Emily had bad health most of her life, and she died of a heart attack at the age of seventy four. Many of her paintings are in the Art Gallery of Vancouver in British Columbia and today she is one of Canada's most famous painters. There is also an Art school in the city of Vancouver named after her: The Emily Carr College of Art and Design.
