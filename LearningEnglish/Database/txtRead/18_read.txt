Israel and Palestine have been at war with each other for many years now. The reason behind the conflict is religion. Palestine is a very old country lying in the Middle East. It is an Arabic nation where most of its population is Muslim. Israel lies at the border with Palestine. It is a much younger country formed by Jews, whose religion is <b>radically</b> and completely different from the Muslim religion.

Israel grew stronger after the Second World War, when it became a friend and <b>ally</b> of the United States. It started to occupy land from surrounding countries based on the fact that Jews used to live on that land thousands of years ago. In order to stop a war, the leaders of Israel and Palestine have decided to declare the Gaza Strip, which lies between the two countries, a neutral territory. That means that Gaza does not belong to anyone.

</br>
The solution did not <b>work out</b> as planned, however. The problem did not get solved because there were many nationalist groups both in Palestine and Israel who hate each other. The Hamas group is the most powerful terrorist group in the region. They say that Israelis are different and should not live next to other Muslim countries. Hamas is an illegal group that is very much disliked by the Palestinian government. They have done a lot of damage to the peace movement in the area by organizing over 60 suicide bombings since 2000.

That year, the Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon signed an agreement with the Palestinian president Mahmoud Abbas <b>to cease fire</b> in Gaza and stop soldiers from shooting at each other. But Sharon suffered a stroke in January 2006 and is now in a hospital. <b>Elections</b> were held in both countries. In Palestine, many people voted for the Hamas group, while Israelis gave their votes to many different parties. Finally, Ehmud Olmert from the central Kadima party became the Israelis Prime Minister, but he didn't have a lot of support in parliament. While he was trying to form a government, Hamas struck and attacked Israel.

On April 17, 2006, Israelis celebrate Pesach, a big religious holiday. On that day of joy, 18- year-old Sami Samil Hama, who worked as a waiter in a village in Gaza, put a powerful bomb into a blue bag and went to a restaurant in Tel Aviv, the capital of Israel. A security guard saw him and tried to stop him, but Hama opened his bag and <b>blew himself up</b> on the street. Nine other people died in the explosion along with him. There was blood everywhere. Hamas celebrated the attack with shouts of joy and gave out sweets to people on the street. They say the bombing was a result of Israel soldiers killing two Palestinians in Gaza.

But the whole world is in shock. USA called the Tel Aviv bombing a criminal act because so many innocent people who have nothing to do with the war died. Both the USA and the European Union will stop sending money, food and medicine to Palestine. They do not want to help a government that allows teenagers to go out and kill not only themselves, but other people too. Even the Palestinian president was upset and said his government had nothing to do with the killings. Hamas, however, was proud of their terrorist attack. They believe war with Israel will bring Palestine freedom, and plan even more attacks in the future. The world has to be ready to deal with this problem.
