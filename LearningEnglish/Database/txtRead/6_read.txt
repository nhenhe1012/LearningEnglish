Penguins are a type of flightless, <b>aquatic</b> bird that live in the earth's Southern oceans. Contrary to what people think, these animals do not live only in cold climates, such as the Antarctic region. Of the 17 penguin species, three live as far as the tropics, while one species goes as far as the Galapagos Islands near the equator. The oldest penguin bones ever found are 40 million years old, and they prove that penguins were already unable to fly at that time.

The body of the penguin is perfect for life under water. It has an aerodynamic shape, which helps the penguin cut through the waves and dive under with great speed. What used to be wings now function as flippers. Fish also have flippers. Flippers look like large side flaps that help push the body forward in the water while swimming. Besides flippers, penguins use their tails to move around. On land, flippers prevent a penguin from <b>losing his balance</b> and falling over. Penguins are further covered with a smooth layer of <b>plumage</b>. These feathers help a penguin float and also keep the body warm.
Penguins also keep warm when sliding on their bellies across snow and ice. This movement is called tobogganing and allows these animals to not waste their energy.

Penguins are usually dark in color, and have a white belly. These colors protect them from other animals, such as killer whales and sea lions, which hunt penguins for food. These animals often cannot <b>tell</b> penguins and water <b>apart</b>. When they look at the white belly of a penguin from below, they often mistake it for water. The dark colored skin offers similar protection to penguins outside of the water. Penguins have a very special way of moving across land. They waddle; that is they make short steps and rock slowly back and forth while moving. They are mistakenly thought to be slow and clumsy, but in fact are very <b>agile</b> and lively.

Penguins are extremely fast and skilled swimmers and divers. Their average speed is 12 km/h, yet when they dive they can reach up to 27km/h. Small penguins, such as the Little Blue Penguin, catch fish close to the water surface and do not stay longer than a couple of minutes under water. Large penguins, like the Emperor, however, can dive as deep as 565 meters and stay under for up to 20 minutes if necessary. Penguins feed on shrimp, fish, squid and other small sea animals. They have excellent hearing, and can also see underwater.

Penguins usually mate for life and live together with only one partner. Both parents take care of their youngsters; the female penguin goes out to hunt for food, while the male penguins stays behind to protect their few babies.

Sometimes, baby penguins do not survive the harsh storms of the South Pole or are killed by other animals. In that case, the mother penguins often feels so much pain that she tries to steal another mother's living chick. Specialists have studied this interesting behavior, and are convinced that it is similar to human emotions.

The truth is that penguins are very friendly animals and are not afraid of people. Whenever a cruise ship lands, penguins<b> gather around </b>and get together in groups to meet the boats of tourists or explorers. For that reason, perhaps, penguins have often been the main characters in many children's books, movies, cartoons, and even video games. A town in New Zealand is called Penguin, and many sports teams use penguins as a mascot.
