Easter is a religious holiday celebrated throughout the Christian world. According to Christian religion, God sent his son Jesus to Earth to show men the right path. But his message of peace was not welcomed. Jesus was caught while entering the Holy city of Jerusalem, and<b> crucified</b> on a Friday morning. Miraculously, however, Jesus rose from the dead on Sunday morning. Christians believe Jesus died on the cross in order to save their souls. They celebrate this event during the Easter holidays.

</br>
Eastern Christians, or Orthodox Christians, are very traditional. Unlike Western Christians, they still use the oldest calendar available, the Julian calendar. According to this calendar, the date Jesus died on the cross is sometime in April or May. This day is more important in the Orthodox calendar than Christmas. 
</br>
</br>
Thus, a month before Easter, Orthodox Christians start<b> fasting</b>. They do not eat any meat or dairy, products, like milk or eggs. They do not drink alcohol, and do not entertain themselves. This period of fasting is called the Great Lent and is supposed to clean their bodies and souls from sins. On Good Friday, when Jesus was crucified, Orthodox Christians do not take in anything but bread and water. They go to church and pray. All lights in the Church go out on midnight on Saturday, except one candle. Christians light their own candle from this one Holy Candle in honor of Jesus Christ.

</br>
Sunday morning, or Easter Sunday, is a time of joy and happiness and the most important day for Orthodox Christians. It is the time when Jesus rose from the dead. Families greet each other on the street by saying "Christ is risen!" The traditional reply is "Truly He is risen!" . Nobody is allowed to fast for the next week, which is called the Bright Week. The traditional meal during this time is lamb, red wine, and a type of sweet bread believed to represent the body of Christ.

<b> Easter in the Western Christian Culture </b>
</br>
</br>
The Christian Church<b> split up</b> at the beginning of the 12th century because of some technical differences. It got divided after important churchmen could not agree on which calendar to use when calculating religious holidays. 
</br>
</br>
The head of the Western Christian Church was the Pope in Rome. He is still the leader of this Church, which is now called the Roman Church or the Catholic Church. Catholics use the more modern Gregorian calendar to calculate religious holidays. Pope Gregory XIII <b>devised</b> the Gregorian calendar in order to simplify the ancient Julian calendar invented by the Roman Emperor Julius Caesar.
</br>
</br>
According to the Gregorian calendar, Easter falls anytime from March 22nd to April 25th. Therefore, in some years, Catholic and Orthodox Easter are a month apart, while in other years they fall right on the same date.
At the World Council of Churches in 1997, churchmen tried <b>to meet in the middle</b> and agree on celebrating Easter on the same date in both Churches. Unfortunately, after a lot of arguments, they couldn't decide on a common date and <b>the matter was dropped</b>. For now at least, Catholic Easter will still be celebrated on a different time than Orthodox Easter.
</br>
</br>
But the meaning of the holiday remains the same. Catholic Christians also fast before Easter. On Saturday night, they meet in church for prayers. They read Bible stories, sing religious songs or hymns, and light the Holy Candle. Then, the priest sprinkles churchgoers with holy water, and offers them holy wine and bread. Religious services are also held on Easter Sunday and Easter Monday.
</br>
</br>
Many Western countries, such as Germany, Canada or the USA, also follow other nonreligious Easter traditions. They paint eggs Saturday night and hide them everywhere around the house. Children go egg hunting on Sunday morning, when they get many chocolate eggs and gifts from the Easter Bunny.
