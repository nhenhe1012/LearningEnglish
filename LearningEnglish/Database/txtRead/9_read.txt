The Middle Ages refer to the time period between approximately 1100 to around 1450 AD. At that time, <b>medieval </b>Europe was completely controlled by the powerful Christian Church. The Church's influence all aspects of human life, even art. Many buildings at that time were churches or<b> cathedrals</b>. They were all built in a special style, called Gothic.

The Gothic style was first introduced by a French churchman. Abbot Suget wanted to celebrate the existence of God on Earth by creating a cathedral that resembled life in Heaven. He <b>came up with</b> the design for the abbey church near Paris. The design he imagined was that of a very tall and straight building. The roof had the shape of a pyramid and was very pointed, and is known as a spire. The outside walls contained many spirals and thin and slender columns. The facade or front of the church was very impressive as it was meant to be the entrance into Paradise. Suget also designed a rose window, which became typical for all Gothic cathedrals. The rose window is round and made of stained glass, which is colored with the help of metallic salts. The rose window is usually placed on the western side of Gothic cathedrals. It is a symbol of the Holy Virgin Mary, a very important figure in Christian religion. The most impressive rose windows are the ones at Notre Dame de Paris, Chartres, Rouen and Saint Paul's Cathedral in London.

Besides rose windows, Gothic cathedrals have many other tall and arched stained glass windows. Along with the sharply pointed spires and slender columns, these glass windows create an <b>ethereal</b>, very light and airy look. They allow a lot of light to enter the cathedral. Once inside, the visitor cannot help but be impressed. Everything just<b> takes your breath away</b>. The high ceilings, the tall, straight lines, the soft light, all have a magical effect on you. It is said that this atmosphere made people who had lost their faith in God just fall on their knees and pray. The message was that God was all-powerful, while humans were small and unimportant in comparison to Him.

Gothic cathedrals were decorated with many sculptures and paintings. They all had religious meanings, and were usually stories taken from the Bible or images of Saints. Gothic sculptures are different in that they are very natural looking. They remained a model for the next generation of sculptors. Gothic paintings appeared almost 50 years after Gothic sculptures and buildings. They are very emotional, dark and somber looking. Gothic paintings appear in four different forms. Frescoes are paintings done directly on the church wall, whereas panel paintings are done on woodwork. Illuminated manuscripts are fine paintings done on paper that decorate holy books and pieces of writings. There is also the art of stained glass done on church windows.

The Gothic style also<b> made inroads in</b> areas not connected to religion. There are many Gothic castles and palaces. Some of them, built in Germany, Poland and Scandinavia, are made out of brick instead of stone. This special style is called Brick Gothic.

The Gothic age came to an end around 1500 and was replaced by the Italian Renaissance Art. But the 18th century knew a period of Gothic Revival. The House of Parliament in London and the University of Glasgow are all built in the Gothic style. In the 20th century, the Neo-Gothic style is present in famous buildings such as the universities of Princeton and Yale, and even in the De Ridder jailhouse in Louisiana, built in 1941.
