Genghis Kan was probably born in the year 1162 as the son of a minor Mongol chief. His family, like all the other people in the region, were <b>nomads</b>. They lived in the mountainous region around the river Onon, but they never stayed in just one place. During that time, Mongol families lived together in larger groups, called clans, to protect each other from danger and to find food more easily. A few clans formed a tribe that was led by a chief. Tribes were always at war with each other for domination and control of the area.

Most Mongol nomads were blacksmiths; they worked with iron, made weapons, and trained strong little horses for battle. When Genghis Khan was little, his name was actually Temujjin. This means "iron" in the Mongol dialect. As was the custom of his age, Temujjin was sent to live with the tribe of his future wife at the age of nine. He was supposed to return home when he turned twelve but his father was poisoned by one of the neighboring clans.

Temujjin returned <b> to claim his right</b> as leader. He said that he was to become chief now, but the clan elders refused to listen to a young boy and abandoned him. Temujjin and his family lived in poverty over the next few years. They <b>scraped a meager living</b> by picking fruits and hunting. Temujjin displayed the first signs of his<b> cruel</b> and unkind character when he killed his half-brother over some hunted animal and showed no compassion or mercy afterwards. In 1182, he was taken prisoner by his former clan members who planned to kill him. But he managed to escape with the help of some friends and <b>allies</b>. These events further shaped Temujjin's character. From his mother, he learned the importance of living a simple life and surviving in the harsh world of Mongol nomads. From his time as a prisoner, he learned how important it is to have loyal and faithful allies.

At the age of 16, Temujjin married his childhood bride, Borte, from the neighboring tribal clan. But Borte too was kidnapped by the rivaling Merkits. Temujjin showed his unbelievable intelligence when he designed a master plan and rescued her. Nine months after the escape, Borte gave birth to a son, Jochi. It is believed that the boy is not actually Temujjin's son, although Temujjin always declared that he was Jochi's true father. Borte gave Temujjin many more sons and would remain the love of his life.

Around 1190, Temujjin and his close allies and advisers began to unite the many divided Mongol clans. Using his strong will and charisma, he managed to persuade all those fighting and warring clans to accept him as the one and only leader. It seems Temujjin had a gift, the unusual ability to act as a leader and command respect. Several tribes tried to oppose him. There were a lot of betrayals and killings, but eventually Temujjin managed to do what nobody had ever done before; unite all Mongols into one nation in 1206. In honor of his achievements, the Mongol clan chiefs gave Temujjin the title Khan, or "leader".

Between 1207 and 1227, Genghis Khan defeated all countries surrounding his territory, including China and Persia. The Mongol Empire was at the time the largest in the world. Genghis Khan is believed to have died in battle in 1227. Legend has it he was thrown off a horse, got sick with fever and <b>passed away</b> soon after. Nobody knows where he was buried.
