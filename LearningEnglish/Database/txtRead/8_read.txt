Glaciers are large rivers of ice that form on land and move when gravity pulls them down. Snowflakes fall down onto slopes and down the hills over a large period time. This snow<b> piles up</b> into layers that get bigger and bigger as they get on top of each other. Since the weather changes often in mountain areas, the snow melts and then freezes back again. Over time, this melting and freezing changes the snow and makes it look like a piece of ice, or granular snow. The snow layers on top put pressure on this granular ice and make it even harder. This is how glacial ice is formed.

The lower layers of glacial ice flow all the time because of pressure from the top. The glacier as a whole moves slowly like thick mud does. At this point, glaciers do not need a slope to flow downhill. The upper layers put enough pressure on the bottom layers<b> to keep up </b>the downward movement without stopping. The upper layers of the glaciers are influenced by the weather. Therefore, the ice on top is not so smooth and is more<b> brittle</b>. It breaks easily, almost like glass, and can be very dangerous to walk on. Sometimes, the ice cracks and forms deep crevasses. Another danger comes from the bottom layers. The glacial ice flowing in there also cuts channels through the ice. These channels are similar to caves inside rocks. They are a<b> hazard</b> too. People who walk on glaciers have to be careful because they never know when they will step on such a cave.

The upper part of the glacier gets a lot of snow and is called the accumulation zone. 60-70% of a healthy glacier is an accumulation zone. The opposite end of the glacier is called deposition or ablation zone. This is where the ice melts and no fresh snow gets on top. The deposition zone carries a lot of small rocks and sediments that pile up at the foot of the glacier. They <b>eat away</b> at the ice and make it thinner and thinner. The place where the ice thins to nothing is called the ice front. Often, glaciers melt and leave behind a hole shaped like a bowl that is called a depression or cirque.

The reason why glaciers melt is the warm weather. In 1850, many glaciers melted or became very small. This period is called the Little Ice Age. Melting glaciers are very normal and common. But after 1980, scientists have discovered that glaciers are melting faster than usual. This melting or <b>retreating</b> of glaciers is the result of global warming. The weather on Earth has become warmer and this has a negative effect on the environment. When glaciers melt, the water flows into valleys and causes big floods. In addition, glaciers are made up of fresh water. Actually, glaciers contain the largest amount of fresh water in the world. When glaciers melt, this fresh water gets mixed with dirt, sand, rocks and salt. It is no longer good for drinking and gets lost.

There are still many glaciers in the world right now. The largest ice field in the world is Antarctica, and other huge glaciers are the Athabasca Glacier in Canada, the Columbia Icefields in the American Rocky Mountains, as well as Vatnayoekull in Iceland. Interestingly enough, many cold areas in the world get too little snow to form glaciers. Such areas are Siberia in Russia, the high Andes mountains in Peru and Chile, and the northern part of Alaska. The only continent without glaciers is Australia.
